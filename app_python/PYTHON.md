# Best Practices in the Web Application

The web application for displaying the current time in Moscow follows several best practices to ensure code quality, maintainability, and reliability. Here are some of the key practices applied:

1. **Modular and Readable Code**: The codebase uses clear and descriptive variable and function names, making it more readable and understandable.

2. **PEP 8 Coding Standards**: The code adheres to the guidelines outlined in PEP 8, the official Python style guide.

3. **Unit Testing**: The application includes a comprehensive suite of unit tests using the `unittest` framework. They ensure that the application behaves correctly and that the expected responses are returned for different scenarios. Test cases cover critical functionality, such as retrieving the current time in Moscow, and handle different scenarios, including edge cases. Automated tests are run regularly to catch any regressions and ensure the accuracy of the time display. 

The unit tests follow best practices such as test isolation, test setup, and test teardown to ensure reliable and repeatable test results. They verify the correctness of the application's logic and help in identifying any potential issues or regressions.

4. **Documentation**: The codebase is well-documented, with inline comments. Additionally, a README.md file is provided with instructions on installation, usage, and any other relevant information to help users understand and utilize the application effectively.

By following these best practices, the web application strives to deliver high-quality code, a maintainable architecture, and accurate display of the current time in Moscow. Besides of unit testing, manual page refreshing for testing was used as well.
